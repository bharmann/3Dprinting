# Summary

The Drawer Divider Construction Set helps you organize your world. Whether for kitchen, office, or workshop you can create a custom divider for any drawer you have. You assemble standardized components into any size you want from a single section paper-clip holder to a multi-section full-drawer divider. Measure your space, design your divider, print your components, assemble your divider, and get organized today.

The components are based upon an 86mm length and width, a 51mm height, and a 3 mm thickness. You choose square bases and rectangular bases. Arrange any number of them any way you want to form a grid of bases. Then insert short and long panels between the bases, slide pillars to hold them tightly together, and put caps on the pillars to finish them off. You even have fillers strips and caps to seal base joints, unused pillar slots, and rectangular panel gaps. 

Altogether, the Drawer Divider Construction Set is an open-ended general-purpose system of bases, panels, and pillars to create a wide range of drawer dividers and more. Start from here and extend it in new ways for your own uses. For example, add horizontal and vertical label holders. It's up to you and your imagination.

Technical notes: Inspiration from Elgo Skyline Building Construction Set. Design developed in FreeCAD. Pillar and caps have a single center support already in the STL files. Print panels, and filler strips with supports. Samples printed on Prusa i3 MK3 in PLA with 0.2 mm layer height. The interlock of pieces may require multiple-hands to hold pieces together while assembling. Press fit may be tight, and may require a block of wood and some "persuasion" to get it together. 

Update 2018-02-20: Added Base-2x2.
