# Summary

Z-REX's (pronounced "Zee - Rex") are small, easy and fun prints of a dinosaur model... with an opening mouth / jaws and teeth that bite. 

No support required... just print it with at least 3 shells and 50% or more infill to make the jaws / mouth springy so they open and close.

At standard scale Z-REX's are 125mm long. You can safely uniformly scale them up (as this will increase internal clearances), but scaling them down may result in the mouth / jaws not moving.   

Please refer to the images provided and print instructions for additional information... and post photos of your Z-REX's.
 
Z-REX's work in the same way as my SHARKZ / CROCZ / EAGLEZ etc. These prints can be found at:
