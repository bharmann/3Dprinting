# Summary

This is a soap tray that can be configured in single or double configuration to hold two bars of bath soap size bars.  The tray will fit onto any 1" shower caddy pole.  It will fit - you just need to force it to clip on, and there is a hole in the support for securing the tray with a zip tie for added support.  I printed this with PLA and just re-print the tray when it gets gunked up.  It works!

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: Prusa
Printer: Prusa Mk2
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: .02
Infill: 30
Filament_brand: Trans Blue
Filament_material: PLA

Notes: 
You can print this in .02 or higher res and it will be fine.  Use 2-part epoxy to connect the parts.  I used 5 minute setting epoxy.  You could use CA glue as well and it should hold up but I used epoxy just to be sure it would hold.
