# Summary

Rubber bands are still an everyday thing we have around home, at work, in workshops and at school... but usually they are never organised and end up stored in a tangled mess in a container. The Rubber Band Organizer is a quick and easy print that lets you organize your rubber bands by size and store them away neatly for ease of use in the future. 

This is a handy little thing to have for your own use at home as well as to tidy up your workspace or classroom. They can also be used for the same purposes as a small gift.... and look great printed in any color.  

The Rubber Band Organizer is made for use with most common rubber bands. There are three levels for different sized rubber bands. Using it is simple... just place each rubber band onto the level where it has some tension so it holds itself in place. This makes it easy to identify different sizes / lengths as it sorts longer rubber bands from shorter ones. 

Levels / Accepts the following approximate rubber band sizes:

Top / Small - Rubber bands of up to 35mm diameter or 50mm in length 

Middle / Medium - Rubber bands of up to 50mm diameter or 80mm in length

Bottom / Large - Rubber bands of up to 70mm diameter or 110mm in length

This design can be readily scaled up / down to suit if you commonly use different sizes than those specified above. 

There are no special print settings required but please read the instructions and view the images provided for additional information.... and share images of your Rubber Band Organizer/s in use for others to see.
